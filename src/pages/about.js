                            I am from Brigantine, New Jersey and am a graduate from Rutgers Full Stack Web Development program as well as previously obtaining a Bachelors degree from Stockton University in Finance. I am passionate about coding and everything that comes along with being a full stack web developer. I enjoy working with all parts of web development, but excel with working on the back-end more. I am profecient with JavaScript and HTML and have an itch for learning more CSS. NoSQL databases are my strong suit and something that i understand easily. React is something ive become stronger at and continue to work towards getting better with. Other than coding I enjoy surfing, doing martial arts and playing videogames.
